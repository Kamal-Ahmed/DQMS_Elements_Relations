# Data Quality Management System (DQMS)
The Data Quality working group of the Data Management Association in the Netherlands (DAMA NL), has been developing a Data Quality Management System (DQMS)
using ISO 9001 as a frame of reference.
ISO 9001 is intended for the quality of products and services in general and is
rarely applied to data quality. In order to apply ISO 9001 to data quality, we need to convert the terms of elements used in ISO 9001 to
terms that are common in the data domain.

The elements in the data domain may have specific interdependencies, which are shown in the form of
connections between elements. The connections have properties (labels) and directionality (arrows).

The set of controls can be used to discover elements and their relationships with other elements.
